                            A legendary stronghold, far removed from society and full to the brim with monsters holds the secret
                            of immortality within its walls!  That's what you, the adventurer, are here for to conquer the stronghold
                            and claim immortality for yourself!

                            Stronghold keep was made for RPI's Game Development 2 class. I wrote all of the enemy and boss code, including
                            a behavior tree based AI system, animation code and miscelaneous other things.  It was made as part of a group
                            in a semester.  Other credits can be found on the Itch.io page above.

                            Ray Reflect is a technical demo of shader-based raytraced reflections.  It was made as part of my research and experimenting with both Vulkan and ray tracing.  Lighting is calculated with a deferred renderer: the first pass renderes a G buffer with all the data needed for lighting calculations.  The second step does those lighting calculations and casts a ray to determine reflections.  Ray intersection is calculated as part of the fragment shader during the second pass.

                            3D Pool Simulation was a primarily a physics demonstration.  The physics engine simulates a set of spheres bouncing
                            around a box, and a simple core OpenGL based renderer draws them as wireframes.  Move the mouse around to aim, and
                            click and hold left mouse to charge up and fire.  I made all the physics, graphics, and sounds for the program.

                        <p>Fist Fight is a game about fists and faces.  There is only one goal: punch.  There is only one rule: there are no rules.</p>
                        <p>
                            Fist fight was made at as part of one of RPI Game Development Club's 24hr game jam.  It was a bit of an experiment in
                            multitasking.  Each player controls both of their character's fists at once, one with each joystick.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>From a very young age, I've been fascinated by video games.  When I started learning how they worked, that fascination only grew.</p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Rensselear Polytechnic Institute in 2019 with a dual major in Computer Science and Game Development.  My
                    work includes AAA game experience with Vicarious Visions, large scale web development with Epic Systems, and programming tutoring as an FRC
                    Mentor.  I am currently working as the lead software engineer at Northeast Maritime Institute. My intresets include low-level systems engineering
                    and computer graphics. In my spare time I am working on a game engine, which I have dubbed Cat Engine.
